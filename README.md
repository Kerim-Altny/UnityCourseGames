## 🎮 Projects

### 1. DeliveryDash (Driving Simulation)
A physics-based top-down driving simulation. This project explores collision detection logic and package delivery mechanics.

* **Key Concepts Learned:**
    * **Transform & Translate:** Handling basic object movement and rotation math.
    * **Collision & Trigger Detection:** Logic for picking up packages vs. crashing into obstacles.
    * **Sprite Rendering:** Visual feedback systems (e.g., changing car color upon impact).

### 2. TileVania (2D Platformer)
A classic "Metroidvania" style 2D platformer game. The project focuses on fluid character control, enemy AI behavior, and level design using Tilemaps.

* **Key Concepts Learned:**
    * **Tilemap & Rule Tiles:** Efficient level design and environment creation.
    * **New Input System:** Implementing modern character movement and control.
    * **Animator & Blend Trees:** Managing complex state machines (Running, Jumping, Climbing).
    * **Physics 2D:** Utilizing Rigidbody, Colliders, and gravity manipulation.

* **Key Concepts Learned:**
    * **Pathfinding:** Enemies following specific, pre-determined wave routes.
    * **Object Instantiation:** Dynamic spawning of projectiles and enemies.
    * **Coroutines:** Managing asynchronous events and enemy attack frequencies.
    * **Singleton Pattern:** Implementing centralized managers for Audio and Scoring.
